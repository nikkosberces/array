# Arrays

## Lesson Objectives:

1. Using arrays
2. Using built-in array methods
3. Using loops

### What is Array?

- simply an ordered collection of items (Strig, numbers, or other things)

### Built-in Array methods

1. join - joins all array elements into a string
2. pop - removes the last element from an array
3. push - adds a new element to an array (at the end)
4. shift - removes the first array element
5. unshift - adds a new element to an array (at the beginning)
6. array[0] = "newValue"
7. length - count the total items in an array
8. splice - start index and how many items to delete
9. concat - combines two or more arrays
10. flat - flattens an array
11. slice - cut the arrays into parts

### What is Loop/Looping?

- we are itereting to each item in our array

### What are the common array methods?

1. traditional for loop
2. forEach
3. for of
4. map
5. filter
